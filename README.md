The city of Nashville provides a dataset of known burials in city cemeteries from 1846 through 1979. This dataset holds factual information, but it also offers a fascinating glimpse into historical trends in medicine, literacy, racial equality, and more.

The Nashville City Cemetery Association has asked you to explore the dataset to create charts that can be used in marketing materials. The following exercises are a starting point for exploring the data and creating visualizations.

I created the chart image above for the company to place with an ad. Pivot tables played a big part in moving the data around to find what I wanted and needed.

I used many charts to show different categories of information. From the deaths per year to the top causes of those deaths. I even found the cemetery was the original resting place of a revered president.

Much of the data would be considered 'dirty' or 'rogue' as spellings changed from decade to decade and doctor  to doctor. Full weeks could be spent cleaning the entire dataset I used about half a day to clean the major spelling differences.  

While the Civil War time period is one of the most actively used periods in its history; the Cemetery holds only a small number of soldiers.  

Each column of this data holds interesting secrets. The last I will impart to you before you explore yourself is (`Section/Lot`) held the unexpected, if logical, fact of people sharing graves.
